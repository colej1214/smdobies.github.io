                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-5">Well, Bob, you did it again. You're stuck drinking 16 oz of soaped-down horse piss because you thought "The Hopinator" was a cool name for an 8%, overly bitter IPA. Think again, Bob. You chose wrong and now you're stuck for the next half hour slowly sipping on your glass of poision, recreating flashbacks of the time your mom tried to force soap down your throat when you were 8 because you just learned what "Fuck You" meant and you, the little devil child you were, thought it be a hilarious act of rebillion to try it out on one of the few people who would choose a punishment as cruel and unusual as making you chew up a piece of soap like its a pack of big red, your mother. Dont blame youre mother, Bob. She didnt choose your beer. You did. Bob, we don't want you picking out bad beers anymore and we dont want you thinking about eating soap either, unless youre into that weird shit. You were a devilsh child after all, who knows what kind of things youve gotten yourself into over the years. Anyway, all roads lead to a nice cold beer, so make sure its a good one, a damn good one. Don't get caught in the nightmarish flashbacks of your adolescents, because you thought mixing Big Arnie Shwarz and bitter beer was a solid life choice. You chose wrong and learned what a misnomer is. Have you ever heard of Burger King, Bob? Well, let me just tell you, he aint the king of anything except maybe scaring chidlren, broken ICEE machines, and soggy fries. Sometimes, a beer referencing 1980's Sci-Fi films tastes just as bad as your taste in 1980's cinematography, Bob. Im not here to hate on you or your life choices. Bob, Im just here for your intervention. Say hasta la vista, Bob, because starting today and for the rest of your existence on this bumpy ball traveling throughout the eternally expanding cosmos, I and my compadres are going to help you find beers that not only have great names, but also taste like the greatness they've been named after. From here on out Bob, you get to have your beer and drink it too.&nbsp;<br>-Sean Dobies</h3>

                <h2 class="align-center pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-2">1/26/19: Does Your Beer Have A Presidential Stamp of Approval?</h2>
                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-5">Before I begin, I'd Like to give a shout out to Bill and Ted. If it wasn't for them and their Excellent Adventure and Bogus Journey, I would have not had the access to go back in time and interview the four greatest U.S Presidents of all time. Here, at Beyond The Brews, we determined the four U.S. Presidential G.O.A.T.S based off which Presidents had their faces carved into the side of a giant rock in the middle of bumfuck, South Dakota and which Presidents did not. Sorry South Dakota, but we and the rest of the U.s. are still holding out hope for the establishment of MegaKota. Anyway, thanks to Bill and Ted, I was able to go back in time twice in order to drink some brews with these legends and get some input on each President's favorite beer, thus creating the Mt. Rushmore of Beer. First, I headed back to July 4th, 1776. Some People remember this day as the day the Declaration of Independence was signed, but thats not the most important reason for coming back to this day. On this day, both George Washington, age 44, and Thomas Jefferson, age 33, were at prime ages for holding the knowledge of Earth's best beers. Now, I got there at just the perfect time. . With Beer in hand, jumping around, shouting oh yea, as if he just learned who the kool-aid man was, Jefferson bumped into me as he was walking out of the Pennsylvania State House. I feel to the ground, but I was ok. With a quirky smile on his face, Jefferson reached his hand out to help me up. He asked me if I was ok, and said, "Sorry there, fellow, Im all cranked up because we just signed the Declaration of Independence, but even more I didnt spill one drop of me beer as you took that plummit to the ground!" Rambling onward, Jefferson said "Since I knocked you over and I am basically one of the owners of this entire country, I owe ya one, Im off to celebrate, you should tag along!" I said, "Sure thing, Mr. Jefferson, where are we celebrating." Just my luck, Jefferson responded, "Hey, bud, no need to call me Mr. Jefferson. My friends around here call me Long Tom, and we are off to New York to Celebrate." &nbsp;Jefferson was a big guy, easily over 6 ft. in stature, so i responded to keep the conversation going as we walked onward, "Long Tom, the men around here call you that because you're taller than em all?" Long Tom, took a nice chug from his beer and said, "Ahh bud, that nickname comes from the ladies," as he gave me an awkward looking wink. All i could do was give a little chuckle and say, "oh, well good for you Long Tom, good for you." I started to question how Jefferson would have been able to be so successful with a rumor like that spreading throughout this era and even more, if its true, and he got around, was one of the greatest Presidents of all time, throwing dick around catching STD's throughout his tenure. But quickly, I regained my thought and asked Tom what was in New York. He responded, "Ah, well I'm off to go meet up with Commander Washington to bring some beer and the good news to him and his men as they continue to fight for our Indepence from that cock-sucking King George over in Great Britain. Yea, I didnt know Long Tom was such a crazy dude either. I quickly said, "heck ya, i'll join along," knowing that I'd now have the chance to talk with both Washington and Jefferson at the same time. &nbsp;</h3>
