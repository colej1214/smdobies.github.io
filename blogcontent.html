                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-5">Well, Bob, you did it again. You're stuck drinking 16 oz of soaped-down horse piss because you thought "The Hopinator" was a cool name for an 8%, overly bitter IPA. Think again, Bob. You chose wrong and now you're stuck for the next half hour slowly sipping on your glass of poision, recreating flashbacks of the time your mom tried to force soap down your throat when you were 8 because you just learned what "Fuck You" meant and you, the little devil child you were, thought it be a hilarious act of rebillion to try it out on one of the few people who would choose a punishment as cruel and unusual as making you chew up a piece of soap like its a pack of big red, your mother. Dont blame youre mother, Bob. She didnt choose your beer. You did. Bob, we don't want you picking out bad beers anymore and we dont want you thinking about eating soap either, unless youre into that weird shit. You were a devilsh child after all, who knows what kind of things youve gotten yourself into over the years. Anyway, all roads lead to a nice cold beer, so make sure its a good one, a damn good one. Don't get caught in the nightmarish flashbacks of your adolescents, because you thought mixing Big Arnie Shwarz and bitter beer was a solid life choice. You chose wrong and learned what a misnomer is. Have you ever heard of Burger King, Bob? Well, let me just tell you, he aint the king of anything except maybe scaring chidlren, broken ICEE machines, and soggy fries. Sometimes, a beer referencing 1980's Sci-Fi films tastes just as bad as your taste in 1980's cinematography, Bob. Im not here to hate on you or your life choices. Bob, Im just here for your intervention. Say hasta la vista, Bob, because starting today and for the rest of your existence on this bumpy ball traveling throughout the eternally expanding cosmos, I and my compadres are going to help you find beers that not only have great names, but also taste like the greatness they've been named after. From here on out Bob, you get to have your beer and drink it too.&nbsp;<br>-Sean Dobies</h3>

                <h2 class="align-center pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-2">1/26/19: Does Your Beer Have A Presidential Stamp of Approval? -Part 1</h2>
                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-5">Before I begin, I'd Like to give a shout out to Bill and Ted. If it wasn't for them and their Excellent Adventure and Bogus Journey, I would have not had the access to go back in time and interview the four greatest U.S Presidents of all time. Here, at Beyond The Brews, we determined the four U.S. Presidential G.O.A.T.S based off which Presidents had their faces carved into the side of a giant rock in the middle of Bumfuck, South Dakota and which Presidents did not. Sorry South Dakota, but we and the rest of the U.S. are still holding out hope for the establishment of MegaKota. Anyway, thanks to Bill and Ted, I was able to go back in time twice in order to drink some brews with these legends and get some input on each President's favorite beer, thus creating the Mt. Rushmore of Beer. First, I headed back to July 4th, 1776. Some People remember this day as the day the Declaration of Independence was signed, but thats not the most important reason for coming back to this day. On this day, both George Washington, age 44, and Thomas Jefferson, age 33, were at prime ages for holding the knowledge of Earth's best beers. Now, I got there at just the perfect time. With Beer in hand, jumping around, shouting oh yea, as if he just learned who the kool-aid man was, Thomas Jefferson bumped into me as he was walking out of the Pennsylvania State House. I feel to the ground, but I was ok. With a quirky smile on his face, Jefferson reached his hand out to help me up. He asked me if I was ok, and said, "Sorry there, fellow, Im all cranked up because we just signed the Declaration of Independence, but even more I didnt spill one drop of me beer as you took that plummit to the ground!" Rambling onward, Jefferson said "Since I knocked you over and I am basically one of the owners of this entire country, I owe ya one. Im off to celebrate and you should tag along!" I said, "Sure thing, Mr. Jefferson, where are we celebrating?" Jefferson was quick to respond, "Hey, bud, no need to call me Mr. Jefferson. My friends around here call me Long Tom!" &nbsp;Jefferson was a big guy, easily over 6 ft. in stature, so to keep the conversation going I asked, "Long Tom, the men around here call you that because you're taller than em all?" Tom took a deep chug from his beer and said, "Ahh bud, that nickname comes from the ladies," as he gave me an awkward looking wink. All i could do was give a little chuckle and say, "oh, well good for you Long Tom, good for you." I started to question how Jefferson would have been able to be so successful with a rumor like that spreading throughout this era and even more, if its true, and he got around like the nickname implies, was one of the greatest Presidents of all time, throwing dick around catching STD's throughout his tenure? But quickly, I regained my thought and asked Tom again where we were headed. To my luck, he responded, "Ah, well I'm off to New York to celebrate with Commander Washington. Me and some fellows want to bring some beer and the good news to him and his men as they continue to fight for our Indepence from that cock-sucking King George over in England. Yea, I didnt know Long Tom was such a deviant dude either. I quickly said, "heck ya, i'll join along," knowing that I'd now have the chance to talk with both Washington and Jefferson at the same time. The trip from Pennsylvania to New York was long, but listening to Tom and his entourage shoot the shit, telling stories of bar fights, getting thrown out of brothels, and hunting trips gone wrong, rest in peace Tom's friend Wiley Willie, all while slinging back a few brews a long the way. We finally arrived to Washington's camp in New York and boy, were the troops glad to see us. See, the Declaration of Indepence had been signed, yet none of the troops knew and their was still war to be fought, but they knew just the sight of us was a good sign. The men starting going ballistic when we hopped of our high horses and pulled back the cover of our wagons, revealing a few dozen kegs of the nations most up-and-coming lager, Samuel Adams. At this time, Sam Adams beer was still in its research and development phase as Sammy Adams, 44 years young, was at the beginning of his beer making days. But by God was that brew some of the dandiest brew Ive ever had the pleasure of consuming. The men were going wild and out of the biggest tent in the camp came a man with a prescence no other could match. I knew this had to be the great George Washington. George began to walk over to Thomas as Thomas, still inebriated with beer in hand, was directing his buddies to unload the kegs. As Washington approached, with the sway of an Olympic God, Jefferson shouted to him, "Hey, Georgy Boy, come get yourself a drink, if you're wife still lets you! Ha Ha!" (I'd later find out that George had had some wild nights with T.J. that led to Mrs. Washington no longer allowing George to drink with him.) George's aura of a God dissolved as I heard him say in a squicky, voiced whisper, "Shut up Tommy, just give me a beer and don't say anything to Martha about it." Long Tom responded, "Chill out Georgy Boy, relax, I'm here to celebrate, the declaration has been signed, the land is ours!" As he said this, T.J. took a grab of George, tryng to wrap an arm around him to give him a noogey, George let out at a sharp smile, but pushed Tom off him, saying, "Let's fucking go, Tommy Boy! Let's fucking go! I Don't think Martha will mind if tonight gets a little crazy then. Long Tom shouted for all to hear, as he finally looked up with his hazy drunk eyes, seeing thousands of men, ranging in ages from so young theyre still shitting their pants to so old theyre back to shitting their pants"Men, the declaration has been signed. Independence is ours. Fuck King George. Fuck England. Tonight we celebrate. TOnight we drink." The men let out an uproar. And as it quieted down for a brief moment, George, having just finished pouring himself the first drink, took a quick gulp, turned toward the crowd and let out an emphatic shriek, "Dilly Dilly." The entire crowd gave him a wierd quiet glance, but good ole drunk Tommy BOy, snagged the drink out of George's hand, chugged the remaining brew, and let out the strongest "Dilly Dilly" the world has ever heard. One man in the front of the crowd continued with his own exclamation "Dilly Dilly" and the next thing you know the whole sea of men is chanting "Dilly Dilly". As the men are chanting, approaching the kegs one after the other, consuming all the beer they can, Long Tom turns towards George, grabs him by the arm and says, "Dilly Dilly. What the fuck is that, George?" George, know already on his 4th mug, says "Oh Tommy Boy, shut the fuck up, I've been at war for quite some time now while your back home slinging your Long Tom rumors around like some playboy." At this point, I couldnt tell if TOmmy and Georgy Boy were the best of friends just throwing shade at each other for the fun of it, or if they generally hating each other. Luckily, for the sake of this trip and the state of our nation, it tUrned out to be the former. If you to are also wondering, "aren't they drinking O.G. Sam Adams, isn't Dilly, Dilly a Bud-light thing?" Well, folks, I'm glad you pay attention and stay woke, because your damn right. Let me just say, it turns out there was a unsettled war between Sam Adams great-grandson, Adam Adams, and Carl Conrad, the founder of Budweiser, which ultimately led Adams to hand over the rights to the infamous slogan. But let's put that history behind us and get back to why we are here in the first place, the Mt. Rushmore of Beers. After hours and hours of partying with the troops during a mid-summers night in New York, I finally got a few minutes of time with heavily drunk George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. All three of us, double digit beers deep, barely walking, barely talking, but I knew I had to find out their answers to the ultimate question, what is the best beer on Earth. So, with the three of us, sitting outside the General's tent, with thousands of drunken soldiers passed out on the ground surrounding the camp, i said, "Hey, Tom, Hey, George, can I ask y'all a question?" Both men, turned towards each other, let out a goofy chuckle, turned back towards me and shouted at the same time "You just Did!" I quickly uttered back, "ah, now i see how someone such as Donald Trump could run this country." They both gave me an empty stare saying "Who?" in which I responded, "Oh, nevermind you fools are drunker than the moon is bright tonight." It was a full moon that night, just so all you readers out there who werent alive on July 4th, 1776 can have some context. At this point, I just came out and asked, "So, whats the best beer a man can drink." Long Tom, turned to George putting his hands on George's shoulders to help push himself up to a standing position, fumbling to keep his balance, as he said, "Let me take this one George, after all I'm the best beer drinker this nations ever seen!" And as he momentarily, gathered his balance and gained complete composure, Thomas Jefferson shouted with ecstacy, "The Greatest Beer a man can ever drink is a free beer! A beer as free as us!" As he stated this, he took one last pull from his final beer, before falling to the ground with a loud thump and passing out. Laying there, passed out on the floor, mug shattered on the floor beside him, with a look of such drunken peace, that was the last I'd see of Good ole Long Tom Jefferson. My eyes turned back to George as he said, "Oh that fucking pansy Tom never was too great at holding his drinks, but man is he one heck of a guy!" To that, me and Washington said a cheers, and Washington stood up now, leading me on a walk throughout the camp, said, "now the greatest beer ever, let me tell you what the greatest beer ever is all about son." Maybe the alcohol had finally caught up with me, but having a beer cheers with Washington and hearing him call me son, I had finally gotten over the habitual squeak in his voive and again recognized him as America's Father. Tuning back into the conversation, back from my regained state of reverance, I turned to see Washington squatted down along the bank of a river, his pants around his ankles, backside to me. To my astonishment, I exclaimed, "WTF man, are you taking a shit? Are you pissing? Are you shitting and pissing at the same time?" Washington turned his head like an owl, still carrying on his business, with dick in one hand and taking a swig from his final beer in the other, he said in the calmest and most sincere of voices, "Get yourself one that can do both, son. Get yourself one that can do both." I was speechless. Completely startled, I said "well alrighty then, george, alrighty then." I turned away and waited for George to finish his duty. When he came, back up from the bank, he slapped me on the back with a wet hand just washed in the river and said, "now that beer we were talking about, you still wanna know what the world's best beer is kiddo." I was kind of upset to get a kiddo instead of a son and a slap on the back from a hand recently washed off of shit with river water, but I was too drunk to give it any care and said yes. Wahington turned to me and said, "now before I answer just let me tell you why a man like me has to shit and piss at the some time." I really didnt care to know why, nor did I want to think about America's Father excreting human feces and fluid at the same time, but if it got me closer to my answer, I knew I had to string along. So Washington in his drunken haze continued, "Im a busy man. Im the leader of this god forsaken nation. All these drunken men lain before you, these are my mine to take care of. It's my duty to make sure these men get home safe to thier wives and kids at the end of this war. It's my job to make sure we win this land from the those chode jugglers over in England and gain our Freedom. I know Tommy Boy, Sam Adams, You, whoever the fuck you are, and the rest of the crew came all the way here to celebrate singing the Declaration and all. Don't get me wrong, its been a great boost for the troops mentality, but this war is far from over. No fucking piece of paper can grant us our freedom. We are gonna have to go Rambo on every single on of these red coat motherfuckers if we ever want to look forward to sitting at home after a long hard day at work, eating a nice meal while slinging back one of Sammy's finest brews, taking a puff from the dankest of John Rolfe and Johnny Hopkin's freshest rolled blunts, man did those guys know their tobacco and weed (thats a story for another time), while watching our wives and children joyfully play in the afternoon sun. Son, it's my duty to make sure each and every one of these men and every man to be brought up in this nation has the opportunity to live out that experience." I chuckled in the middle of Washington's powerful speech. He said, "well what the fuck are you laughing about?" I hated to have to say it, but I responded, "you said duty..." Expecting to have Washington rip me apart for my childish behavior, I let out a sigh of relief when he repsonded with a deep chuckle saying, "duty, he he he, aint that a funny word.:" At that moment, I knew Washington was one cool ass dude. So, I let George continue as we started to make our way back towards his tent. He said, "now, the reason i have to shit and piss at the same time is because i want to make that vision and dream a reality for as many generations of men and women, because one day the beautiful women of our lives will have all the same rights us men do, as i possibly can. And in order to do that son, I have to be as efficient as possible. Dreams wait up for no one. If you want to reach your dreams son, you've got to piss and shit at the same time." I now understood, it was all starting to make sense in my alcohol-infused brain, so I shook my head up-and-d0wn and said "Sir, Yes, Sir" to the commander of our new-born nation. &nbsp;As we reached his tent and he headed through its opening in the front, i said goodnigt and paused for a moment to ponder all that he told me. I was slighlty upset that I didn't complete my mission of finding out his greatest beer, yet I couldn't leave unhappy getting to share a beer with George Washington. And just as I turned to walk away and start my journey back to the time traveling phone booth, for i knew my time here was up, Georgy Boy peaked halfway out of the tent's front opening and said, :"Oh and about that greatest beer, its always the one your currently drinking." He lifted his beer in the air, paused for a second, finished the last gulp of his beer, and dissappeared back into his tent. As i got to the photo booth, before I hit call to bring me back to the present day, I took out my notebook and simply wrote, "Trip One: Success. Thomas Jefferson. Light- Hearted Lunatic. Answer: Free Beer. George Washington. The Ulitmate Enigma. Answer: The Beer You're Currently Drinking."&nbsp;<br>-Sean Dobies&nbsp;</h3>
