# Data-Collection
This branch contains code related to scraping text from public open source news websites. 
This process was performed in using xpath locators from each individual website. These xpath locators are stored in a dictionary that is referenced based on the website. 
If a user would like to add new websites to the analysis, he or she must determine the proper xpath locators for each item on the new website.
